    \subsection{Programming Language Selection and Libraries Used}

    I selected C# as my programming language for several reasons. Currently, it is the language that I am most familiar with. In addition, I conducted research on which languages are best for fast processing, and found that C, C++, and C# are among the top contenders. Considering my skill set and the importance of speed in this situation, I concluded that C# would be a good fit. Furthermore the object orientated nature of the language means that I will be able to separate the front end and the back end processing into separate bll files keeping the code clean and easily maintainable.\\

    Find below a list of all libraries I used: \\
    \subsubsection*{Linq}

    \subsubsection*{Bitmap}
    In order for my program to function a required part of it is that it is able to take an image as an input. In native C# there is no set way to do this. Therefore I needed to use the Microsoft System.Drawing Namespace. This namespace provides access to GDI+ basic graphics functionality. This does limit this project as is to only working on Windows since the library requires access to the GDI+ native library which is only on windows services. \\ The only part of this library I will be using is the Bitmap class. This will allow me to accept all types of images without the need of parsing them myself since this is not the aim of my project.
