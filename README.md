# NEA

This project was completed in the accademic year 2022/23 while I was in my final year of college at Barton Peveril Sixth Form.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to shoot me an email: contact@ru-pirie.com

# Overview
The title of this project is "Alogrithmic Map Recognition and Edge Detection with Point to Point Pathfinding", what this boiled down to a canny edge detector coupled with some interesting logic which allowed it to pick out what where roads and what where buildings using a flood fill algorithm. Then after it had done this it converts the filled map to a graph which can then be clicked on to find the shortest path between two points. All of this was tied together with a nice looking custom GUI using WinForms if I recal.

Here is a nice gif of it doing the pathfinding:


At some point there will be a nice writeup here: [https://ru-pirie.com/projects/personal/nea-extension](https://ru-pirie.com/projects/personal/nea-extension)
